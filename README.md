## About this project
### **How the app works**
This project uses front end and back end design to create a burger logger. When you add a burger to the form field and click on the button, the name is entered into the list of burgers found on the left. Each burger has a Devour Me button and when this is clicked, the burger name moves to the list on the right - to the list of burgers that have been devoured (devoured = true). Once there, each burger has a Throw Away button that allows you to remove the burger - deleting the burger from the user interface and the MySQL database. 

### **How the app was built** 
This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to add (POST), view (GET), devour (PUT) and discard (DELETE) burgers. IT usesa MVC design pattern where Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app. Handlebars is used to generate the HTML using Bootstrap, Shutterstock, Google Fonts and Font Awesome to create the aesthetics.

### **MVC design Pattern**
This project follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, which is a form of  OOP (Object Orientated Programming). The MVC design pattern assigns objects in the application one of three roles (model, view or controller) and defined the way that each part of the application communicated with another.
* model - contains the core functionality and data
* view - displays the information to the user (more than one view may be defined)
* controller - handles the input from the user
